# Up Next — In-Progress Work

**Read this at the start of every new session.** Updated at closing. Shows what's half-built, what's being tested, and what's the next concrete step — so the next session resumes from where the last one ended instead of starting cold.

---

## Active

**Session 116 (2026-05-18)** — Member home pass + first reviewer-subagent run. Three commits live on `main` (`1d3f7b1`, `0b12f99`, `ac2317b`). Branch `claude/sad-hopper-d44915` merged and deleted on origin.

What's now live on `/account/dashboard`:

- **Quiet schedule link in greeting.** `See this week's community schedule →` points to `/this-week` for members who don't pre-register and want to see what the community is doing.
- **Today card is now the single source of truth for today.** Virtual/hybrid live + later rows (Join button when in the 12-min window), plus strictly-in-person registrations with a quiet "In-person" tag. Summary count includes in-person today.
- **"Coming up for you"** (renamed from "Your Programs") sorted ascending by each program's *next* upcoming occurrence — not by registration creation date. Today's sessions filtered out (they're in Today). Programs with no future occurrence filtered out. Each row shows inline time ("Essential Dharma Study · 8:15 AM") and a date pill that's the projected next-occurrence date, not the program's first-ever anchor.
- **Section labels reworded** to stateful sentences: "Your Series" → "Where you're studying," "Your Hubs" → "Where you're contributing." Continuation of the session-110 "Dashboard → Home" direction.
- **`nextOccurrenceOnOrAfter()` helper** in `lib/scheduleUtils.ts`. Walks forward up to `maxDays` from a CT date, returns the next session date or null. Short-circuits for non-recurring past anchors.
- **`prisma/migrate.mjs` guards against missing DB env.** Vercel preview builds were failing because `prisma generate && node prisma/migrate.mjs && next build` ran migrate.mjs unconditionally and preview deploys don't see `POSTGRES_PRISMA_URL`. Guard at top of `main()`: log + return when env is absent. Production unaffected.

**Built, deliberately removed: a standalone "Your next session" block.** Initial plan; reviewer sub-agent caught four real issues mid-build (visual regression, non-deterministic `take` after dropping `orderBy`, 365-day walk for past anchors, stale-pill rendering); Jesse then pushed back on the concept ("should it be there on the dashboard or in a link?"). Pulled it. The schedule link + time-bearing "Coming up for you" rows carry the same info without a third competing surface. Restraint as design principle.

**Collaboration experiments still on probation:**
- **Plan mode** (`EnterPlanMode`) used for the member-home evaluation — produced the written eval before any edits. Worth continuing on non-trivial features.
- **Reviewer sub-agent before commit** caught four real issues on first run. New memory at `feedback-reviewer-subagent.md`. Two more positive passes and it moves into the closing ritual permanently.

**Next concrete step:** hold for Jesse's read on the deployed page. The pass landed restrained — possible follow-ups if he wants more visible weight on the next commitment: (a) make the top row of "Coming up for you" larger / more prominent, (b) broader rethink of whether Today + "Coming up for you" can collapse into one adaptive surface across all states. Plus Maria training session per `TRAINING_PLAN.md` remains the queued downstream item from session 115.

**Deferred from session 113 (still open):**

1. **`volunteer-roles` chapter** — `prisma/seed-manual.ts` updated in-file (SUPPORT removed, GUIDING_TEACHER added), but the DB record at `/admin/manual/volunteer-roles` was not refreshed. Edit manually at `/admin/manual/volunteer-roles/edit`, or write a small `update-manual-volunteer-roles-v2.mjs` script gated by a migration flag.
2. **`host-hub` chapter** — Should mention the Documents notification picker and Archive → Trash flow, and point coordinators to the Trash page.
3. **New `hub-trash` chapter (optional)** — Short chapter explaining the manager-facing Trash page (admins/coordinators/guiding teachers).

**Parked follow-ons from earlier sessions:**

1. **Email template wording in DB** — `registrar-role-assigned` and reminder templates still contain "dashboard" language. Safe path: edit at `/admin/emails`; keep the `dashboardUrl` binding name for now.
2. **`SUPPORT` enum value in `prisma/schema.prisma:135`** — Still present. Removing a Prisma enum value while any user row references it in `roles[]` will crash. Needs a user-records audit (`SELECT id FROM users WHERE 'SUPPORT' = ANY(roles)`) before removal. Out of scope.

**From session 115 (still in backlog):**

1. **Drop legacy `HubConversationThread.status` column** — A couple of UI checks (`HubConvThreadClient.isClosed`, archive toggle buttons in `HubConvClient`) still read `status`. Migrate them to `archivedAt`, then drop the column. Mechanical, low-risk, no rush.
2. **Coordinator-friendly hub content editing for non-host hubs** — Currently welcome / home content on the three non-host hubs (`courses`, `registrar`, `support`) is editable only via the ADMIN form at `/admin/hubs/[slug]/edit`. Either extend `HostHubHomeClient`'s inline edit affordance to all hubs, or build a coordinator-scoped settings page. Decision: which surface?

**New from session 116 (in backlog):**

1. **Functional Vercel preview deploys** — migrate.mjs now skips gracefully on preview builds, but the app itself still has no DB at runtime in preview. Two options: (a) add a staging/preview Postgres and wire its URL to Vercel's Preview env scope, (b) accept that previews are build-only checks (won't run end-to-end). Worth a decision before regular branch work resumes.

**Theme B (Google Meet) remains.** Items #15–17 are still manual steps Jesse will do when ready:
- #15 — Remove four Google Meet env vars from Vercel project settings
- #16 — Revoke/delete the service account in Google Cloud Console
- #17 — Archive or delete `meet1@`–`meet4@` Google Workspace accounts

## Next deliverable candidates

### Editor toolbar polish

Jesse said "I'll address the menu items later" early in session 97. The current toolbar dropdowns (Heading, Callouts, Dharma blocks) and bubble menu contents are reasonable defaults but he may want refinements:

- Specific button choices and order
- Iconography
- Mobile-specific layout changes
- Whether the floating "+" on empty lines should be wired up (Tiptap extension is installed but not used; Notion-style block insertion menu)

Lighter than Webflow weekly schedule but worth a focused pass before the toolbar set in stone.

### Stage 2d editor blocks (Page Designer expansion)

Three blocks in the original Page Designer plan that were never built: Announcement, EarlyArrival, DanaInvitation. They'd replace top-level Program fields (`specialAnnouncement`, `earlyArrivalMessage`, the page-rendering of `danaMessage`) with inline blocks the author places where they want.

Now that the Tiptap migration is complete, these blocks can be added as Tiptap extensions (mirror existing `Callout`, `PullQuote`, etc. in `components/rim-tiptap/extensions/`). Plus a data migration that reads the legacy fields and inserts matching blocks at the end of the description.

Not blocked by anything. Each block is a small, contained piece of work.

### BlockNote walker eventual removal

Once every row in the database has been edited and saved as HTML, the BlockNote-JSON walker in `lib/renderRichContent.ts` and `lib/renderRichContentServer.ts` can be removed. Until then it's the safety net for unmigrated content. No deadline; depends on user activity. Worth checking the database periodically (`SELECT COUNT(*) FROM ... WHERE jsonb_typeof(field) = 'array'`) to know when it's safe.

## Smaller items still parked

- **Vercel `NEXTAUTH_URL` trailing space** — code is defensively trimmed in five places (`lib/email.ts`, `lib/calendarLinks.ts`, `lib/supportNotify.ts`, `app/api/cron/drip-release`, `app/api/stripe/checkout`); the env var itself should still be cleaned at the source so future surfaces don't pick up the same bug. One-time edit in Vercel project settings.
- **Coordinator notes area** — `Hub.coordinatorNotes Json?` (or HTML, post-migration) + coordinator-only editor surface. Was discussed during the team-management work; never built.
- **Duplicate-Aside backlog item** — Editor allows inserting an Aside immediately after another Aside. Was true with BlockNote's structure; may not apply post-Tiptap-migration. Revisit if it's still observable.
- **Hub document export** — fixed session 102. HTML documents export as `.html`; legacy BlockNote JSON documents still export as `.md`. Both paths tested via TypeScript.

---

## Permanent reminders (still true)

- **Hub membership is authoritative when it exists.**
- **No-delete policy for HubMember.** Never call `db.hubMember.delete()` outside the ADMIN-only route.
- **Use `after()` from `next/server` for fire-and-forget email sends in route handlers.** `void (async () => {})()` is silently killed by Vercel's serverless teardown.
- **Trim `NEXTAUTH_URL`-derived constants.** Every `BASE_URL` does `.trim().replace(/\/$/, "")` because env vars can carry whitespace.
- **Every `sendTemplatedEmail(slug, …)` must ship with a matching seed entry in `prisma/migrate.mjs` in the same commit** (Email Template Gate, CLAUDE.md). Missing templates silently no-op — recipients get nothing. Use defensive `findUnique → create` so any manual `/admin/emails` edits are preserved.
- **Trash-management authority lives in one place:** `canManageTrash(roles, isCoordinator)` in `lib/hubAuth.ts`. ADMIN, GUIDING_TEACHER, or hub coordinator. Use this helper anywhere trash visibility or restore/permanent-delete gating is needed — don't reimplement the role check inline.
- **Coordinator-level authority lives in one place:** `effectiveCoordinator(member, roles)` in `lib/hubAuth.ts`. Returns true for hub-coordinator flag, ADMIN, or GUIDING_TEACHER (GT acts as soft admin at the content layer on every hub). Use this helper anywhere you'd previously written `(member?.isCoordinator ?? false) || isAdmin`. Don't inline the boolean.
- **Hub-thread filter shape lives in one place:** `activeHubThreadWhere(hubId)` in `lib/hubQueries.ts`. Returns `{ hubId, documentId: null, deletedAt: null, archivedAt: null }`. Use it for any findMany / count surfacing hub-level threads to members. Don't inline the filter; the three previous drift bugs (`status: { not: "ARCHIVED" }`, missing `documentId: null`, missing `deletedAt: null`) all happened by inlining.
- **`archivedAt`, not `status`, is the canonical archive marker for hub threads.** `HubConversationThread` now mirrors `HubDocument` (session 115). The `status` column is kept in sync by the PATCH route for backward compat but will be dropped in a future cleanup. Don't write new code that reads `status` to determine archive state.
- **Three-stage hub delete is enforced at both UI and API layers.** The UI hides the Delete button on non-archived items; the API returns 400 with "Archive this … first" unless the item is archived. Both rules matter — the UI is the friendly path, the API is the hard guard against direct calls.
- **Resolve `Program.name` from the slug before sending any host email.** Slugs are URL-safe but ugly — `essential-dharma-study-2024-07-14` in an email body is a reliability issue, not a cosmetic one. Pattern: `await db.program.findUnique({ where: { slug }, select: { name: true } })` near the top of the email-sending block.
- **Storage paradigm for editor content is plain HTML strings.** `RimTiptapEditor` produces HTML directly via `editor.getHTML()`. Renderers accept both HTML and legacy BlockNote JSON via format detection — unmigrated rows still display correctly.
- **The selection bubble menu is the primary formatting surface in editors.** Top toolbar is for insertion-only actions (image, table, hr, callouts, dharma blocks). Don't put inline marks in both — duplicates discovery paths.
- **`useEditor` returns null on first render with `immediatelyRender: false`.** Any `useEffect` that touches refs INSIDE the rendered tree must include `editor` in deps so it re-runs after editor initialization (the early `if (!editor) return null` means refs are null on the first run).
- **`Array.isArray(body)` filters at page level will silently drop HTML.** Pre-Phase-2 code had patterns like `initialBody={Array.isArray(doc.body) ? doc.body : null}` — these reject HTML strings and pass null, causing content-appearing-missing bugs. Trust the editor component's own `isHtmlString` / `renderBlockNoteHtml` normalization; don't filter at the page.
- **Tiptap's empty-document HTML is `"<p></p>"`, not `""`.** `!draft` truthiness checks fall through. Use `html.replace(/<[^>]+>/g, "").trim().length > 0` to detect meaningful content.
- **`html { overflow-x: clip }`, not `hidden`.** `overflow-x: hidden` creates a scroll container that breaks `position: sticky` for descendants in Safari/Chromium. `clip` clips overflow without making the element scrollable.
