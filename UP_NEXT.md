# Up Next — In-Progress Work

**Read this at the start of every new session.** Updated at closing. Shows what's half-built, what's being tested, and what's the next concrete step — so the next session resumes from where the last one ended instead of starting cold.

## Active

**Session 113 (2026-05-13)** — Hub notifications + subscriptions + three-stage delete + host confirmation emails + residue cleanup. Eight commits, all live on `main`.

What's now live for every hub:

- **Per-document notifications** (Basecamp-style picker, server-side dedup, PDF upload via Vercel Blob)
- **Conversation thread subscriptions** (`HubThreadSubscription` model, Follow/Unfollow pill, "+ Notify someone new" picker on replies, automatic backfill for every existing thread)
- **Three-stage Archive → Trash lifecycle** on documents and threads (deliberate two-step process; senior leadership owns final delete)
- **`GUIDING_TEACHER` role** in the Role enum + `canManageTrash` helper in `lib/hubAuth.ts`
- **Trash page** at `/account/hub/[slug]/trash` (sidebar link gated; non-managers redirected away)
- **Host assignment confirmation emails** wired into every path that makes someone a host (sub-claim, self-claim, manager assignment, PATCH claim, reassign); reassign also notifies the displaced host
- **Cleanup**: Tasks/Alerts/Support-Inbox residue removed across code, migrations, docs, and backlog (≈ 900 lines deleted in two commits)
- **CLAUDE.md "Email Template Gate"** — discipline rule that every `sendTemplatedEmail(slug, …)` must ship with a matching seed entry in `migrate.mjs`

**Next concrete step:** Maria training session per `TRAINING_PLAN.md`. Sessions 111/112 features (rotation UX, enter-room link) + session 113 features (notifications, subscriptions, trash) all live — confirm visually in the deployed app before training dates.

**Closing-ritual deferred items from session 113 (manual chapter updates):**

1. **`volunteer-roles` chapter** — `prisma/seed-manual.ts` was updated in-file (SUPPORT removed, GUIDING_TEACHER added), but the DB record at `/admin/manual/volunteer-roles` was not refreshed. Either edit it manually at `/admin/manual/volunteer-roles/edit`, or write a small `update-manual-volunteer-roles-v2.mjs` script gated by a migration flag.
2. **`host-hub` chapter** — Should mention the new Documents notification picker and the Archive → Trash flow. Could also point at the Trash page for coordinators.
3. **New `hub-trash` chapter (optional)** — A short chapter explaining the manager-facing Trash page. Audience: admins/coordinators/guiding teachers.

The Conversations chapter was updated in this session (v3, `update_manual_conversations_v3` flag).

**Parked follow-ons from earlier sessions:**

1. **Email template wording in DB** — `registrar-role-assigned` and reminder templates still contain "dashboard" language. Safe path: edit at `/admin/emails`; keep the `dashboardUrl` binding name for now.
2. **`SUPPORT` enum value in `prisma/schema.prisma:135`** — Still present. Removing a Prisma enum value while any user row references it in `roles[]` will crash. Needs a user-records audit (`SELECT id FROM users WHERE 'SUPPORT' = ANY(roles)`) before removal. Out of scope.

**Theme B (Google Meet) remains.** Items #15–17 are still manual steps Jesse will do when ready:
- #15 — Remove four Google Meet env vars from Vercel project settings
- #16 — Revoke/delete the service account in Google Cloud Console
- #17 — Archive or delete `meet1@`–`meet4@` Google Workspace accounts

## Next deliverable candidates

### Editor toolbar polish

Jesse said "I'll address the menu items later" early in session 97. The current toolbar dropdowns (Heading, Callouts, Dharma blocks) and bubble menu contents are reasonable defaults but he may want refinements:

- Specific button choices and order
- Iconography
- Mobile-specific layout changes
- Whether the floating "+" on empty lines should be wired up (Tiptap extension is installed but not used; Notion-style block insertion menu)

Lighter than Webflow weekly schedule but worth a focused pass before the toolbar set in stone.

### Stage 2d editor blocks (Page Designer expansion)

Three blocks in the original Page Designer plan that were never built: Announcement, EarlyArrival, DanaInvitation. They'd replace top-level Program fields (`specialAnnouncement`, `earlyArrivalMessage`, the page-rendering of `danaMessage`) with inline blocks the author places where they want.

Now that the Tiptap migration is complete, these blocks can be added as Tiptap extensions (mirror existing `Callout`, `PullQuote`, etc. in `components/rim-tiptap/extensions/`). Plus a data migration that reads the legacy fields and inserts matching blocks at the end of the description.

Not blocked by anything. Each block is a small, contained piece of work.

### BlockNote walker eventual removal

Once every row in the database has been edited and saved as HTML, the BlockNote-JSON walker in `lib/renderRichContent.ts` and `lib/renderRichContentServer.ts` can be removed. Until then it's the safety net for unmigrated content. No deadline; depends on user activity. Worth checking the database periodically (`SELECT COUNT(*) FROM ... WHERE jsonb_typeof(field) = 'array'`) to know when it's safe.

## Smaller items still parked

- **Vercel `NEXTAUTH_URL` trailing space** — code is defensively trimmed in five places (`lib/email.ts`, `lib/calendarLinks.ts`, `lib/supportNotify.ts`, `app/api/cron/drip-release`, `app/api/stripe/checkout`); the env var itself should still be cleaned at the source so future surfaces don't pick up the same bug. One-time edit in Vercel project settings.
- **Coordinator notes area** — `Hub.coordinatorNotes Json?` (or HTML, post-migration) + coordinator-only editor surface. Was discussed during the team-management work; never built.
- **Duplicate-Aside backlog item** — Editor allows inserting an Aside immediately after another Aside. Was true with BlockNote's structure; may not apply post-Tiptap-migration. Revisit if it's still observable.
- **Hub document export** — fixed session 102. HTML documents export as `.html`; legacy BlockNote JSON documents still export as `.md`. Both paths tested via TypeScript.

## Permanent reminders (still true)

- **Hub membership is authoritative when it exists.**
- **No-delete policy for HubMember.** Never call `db.hubMember.delete()` outside the ADMIN-only route.
- **Use `after()` from `next/server` for fire-and-forget email sends in route handlers.** `void (async () => {})()` is silently killed by Vercel's serverless teardown.
- **Trim `NEXTAUTH_URL`-derived constants.** Every `BASE_URL` does `.trim().replace(/\/$/, "")` because env vars can carry whitespace.
- **Every `sendTemplatedEmail(slug, …)` must ship with a matching seed entry in `prisma/migrate.mjs` in the same commit** (Email Template Gate, CLAUDE.md). Missing templates silently no-op — recipients get nothing. Use defensive `findUnique → create` so any manual `/admin/emails` edits are preserved.
- **Trash-management authority lives in one place:** `canManageTrash(roles, isCoordinator)` in `lib/hubAuth.ts`. ADMIN, GUIDING_TEACHER, or hub coordinator. Use this helper anywhere trash visibility or restore/permanent-delete gating is needed — don't reimplement the role check inline.
- **Three-stage hub delete is enforced at both UI and API layers.** The UI hides the Delete button on non-archived items; the API returns 400 with "Archive this … first" unless the item is archived. Both rules matter — the UI is the friendly path, the API is the hard guard against direct calls.
- **Resolve `Program.name` from the slug before sending any host email.** Slugs are URL-safe but ugly — `essential-dharma-study-2024-07-14` in an email body is a reliability issue, not a cosmetic one. Pattern: `await db.program.findUnique({ where: { slug }, select: { name: true } })` near the top of the email-sending block.
- **Storage paradigm for editor content is plain HTML strings.** `RimTiptapEditor` produces HTML directly via `editor.getHTML()`. Renderers accept both HTML and legacy BlockNote JSON via format detection — unmigrated rows still display correctly.
- **The selection bubble menu is the primary formatting surface in editors.** Top toolbar is for insertion-only actions (image, table, hr, callouts, dharma blocks). Don't put inline marks in both — duplicates discovery paths.
- **`useEditor` returns null on first render with `immediatelyRender: false`.** Any `useEffect` that touches refs INSIDE the rendered tree must include `editor` in deps so it re-runs after editor initialization (the early `if (!editor) return null` means refs are null on the first run).
- **`Array.isArray(body)` filters at page level will silently drop HTML.** Pre-Phase-2 code had patterns like `initialBody={Array.isArray(doc.body) ? doc.body : null}` — these reject HTML strings and pass null, causing content-appearing-missing bugs. Trust the editor component's own `isHtmlString` / `renderBlockNoteHtml` normalization; don't filter at the page.
- **Tiptap's empty-document HTML is `"<p></p>"`, not `""`.** `!draft` truthiness checks fall through. Use `html.replace(/<[^>]+>/g, "").trim().length > 0` to detect meaningful content.
- **`html { overflow-x: clip }`, not `hidden`.** `overflow-x: hidden` creates a scroll container that breaks `position: sticky` for descendants in Safari/Chromium. `clip` clips overflow without making the element scrollable.
