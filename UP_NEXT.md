# Up Next — In-Progress Work

**Read this at the start of every new session.** Updated at closing. Shows what's half-built, what's being tested, and what's the next concrete step — so the next session resumes from where the last one ended instead of starting cold.

---

## Active

**Session 108 (2026-05-07)** completed schedule tool polish ahead of the Maria training session.

- **Standing Rotations panel**: grouped by program (multiple occurrence records now show as one chip), chip layout replaces gray-box paragraph list. `HubScheduleClient.tsx` + CSS.
- **Form cleanup**: "Pair weeks" pattern removed (3 patterns remain: Same / Alternate / Custom). 5th-week host field collapsed behind a reveal link by default. Grid dims to 40% opacity on non-editing rows while a form is open. `RotationsClient.tsx` + API route validation.
- **Pattern preview**: last 6 upcoming sessions with projected host names, shown live as the form is filled. Pure client-side logic. `RotationsClient.tsx` + CSS.

All deployed. Vercel build triggered from branch `claude/stoic-mendel-eb67fc`.

**Next concrete step:** Jesse reviews on Vercel, then sets [TBD] dates in `TRAINING_PLAN.md` and the hub training document, coordinates Maria's onboarding per §2 of the plan.

**Theme B (Google Meet) remains.** Items #15–17 are manual steps Jesse will do when ready:
- #15 — Remove four Google Meet env vars from Vercel project settings
- #16 — Revoke/delete the service account in Google Cloud Console
- #17 — Archive or delete `meet1@`–`meet4@` Google Workspace accounts

## Next deliverable candidates

### Editor toolbar polish

Jesse said "I'll address the menu items later" early in session 97. The current toolbar dropdowns (Heading, Callouts, Dharma blocks) and bubble menu contents are reasonable defaults but he may want refinements:

- Specific button choices and order
- Iconography
- Mobile-specific layout changes
- Whether the floating "+" on empty lines should be wired up (Tiptap extension is installed but not used; Notion-style block insertion menu)

Lighter than Webflow weekly schedule but worth a focused pass before the toolbar set in stone.

### Stage 2d editor blocks (Page Designer expansion)

Three blocks in the original Page Designer plan that were never built: Announcement, EarlyArrival, DanaInvitation. They'd replace top-level Program fields (`specialAnnouncement`, `earlyArrivalMessage`, the page-rendering of `danaMessage`) with inline blocks the author places where they want.

Now that the Tiptap migration is complete, these blocks can be added as Tiptap extensions (mirror existing `Callout`, `PullQuote`, etc. in `components/rim-tiptap/extensions/`). Plus a data migration that reads the legacy fields and inserts matching blocks at the end of the description.

Not blocked by anything. Each block is a small, contained piece of work.

### BlockNote walker eventual removal

Once every row in the database has been edited and saved as HTML, the BlockNote-JSON walker in `lib/renderRichContent.ts` and `lib/renderRichContentServer.ts` can be removed. Until then it's the safety net for unmigrated content. No deadline; depends on user activity. Worth checking the database periodically (`SELECT COUNT(*) FROM ... WHERE jsonb_typeof(field) = 'array'`) to know when it's safe.

## Smaller items still parked

- **Vercel `NEXTAUTH_URL` trailing space** — code is defensively trimmed in five places (`lib/email.ts`, `lib/calendarLinks.ts`, `lib/supportNotify.ts`, `app/api/cron/drip-release`, `app/api/stripe/checkout`); the env var itself should still be cleaned at the source so future surfaces don't pick up the same bug. One-time edit in Vercel project settings.
- **Coordinator notes area** — `Hub.coordinatorNotes Json?` (or HTML, post-migration) + coordinator-only editor surface. Was discussed during the team-management work; never built.
- **Duplicate-Aside backlog item** — Editor allows inserting an Aside immediately after another Aside. Was true with BlockNote's structure; may not apply post-Tiptap-migration. Revisit if it's still observable.
- **Hub document export** — fixed session 102. HTML documents export as `.html`; legacy BlockNote JSON documents still export as `.md`. Both paths tested via TypeScript.

---

## Permanent reminders (still true)

- **Hub membership is authoritative when it exists.**
- **No-delete policy for HubMember.** Never call `db.hubMember.delete()` outside the ADMIN-only route.
- **Use `after()` from `next/server` for fire-and-forget email sends in route handlers.** `void (async () => {})()` is silently killed by Vercel's serverless teardown.
- **Trim `NEXTAUTH_URL`-derived constants.** Every `BASE_URL` does `.trim().replace(/\/$/, "")` because env vars can carry whitespace.
- **Storage paradigm for editor content is plain HTML strings.** `RimTiptapEditor` produces HTML directly via `editor.getHTML()`. Renderers accept both HTML and legacy BlockNote JSON via format detection — unmigrated rows still display correctly.
- **The selection bubble menu is the primary formatting surface in editors.** Top toolbar is for insertion-only actions (image, table, hr, callouts, dharma blocks). Don't put inline marks in both — duplicates discovery paths.
- **`useEditor` returns null on first render with `immediatelyRender: false`.** Any `useEffect` that touches refs INSIDE the rendered tree must include `editor` in deps so it re-runs after editor initialization (the early `if (!editor) return null` means refs are null on the first run).
- **`Array.isArray(body)` filters at page level will silently drop HTML.** Pre-Phase-2 code had patterns like `initialBody={Array.isArray(doc.body) ? doc.body : null}` — these reject HTML strings and pass null, causing content-appearing-missing bugs. Trust the editor component's own `isHtmlString` / `renderBlockNoteHtml` normalization; don't filter at the page.
- **Tiptap's empty-document HTML is `"<p></p>"`, not `""`.** `!draft` truthiness checks fall through. Use `html.replace(/<[^>]+>/g, "").trim().length > 0` to detect meaningful content.
- **`html { overflow-x: clip }`, not `hidden`.** `overflow-x: hidden` creates a scroll container that breaks `position: sticky` for descendants in Safari/Chromium. `clip` clips overflow without making the element scrollable.
